#The Developer Marketing Guide

[The Developer Marketing Guide](http://www.devmarketingguide.com) is a [Heavybit Community Project](http://www.heavybit.com). Our goal is to collect the best resources for developer marketing in one place, to encourage a conversation about what works, what doesn't, and why, and to openly share that knowledge with the developer company community.

##Contributing

Do you have something to add? We encourage you to share your knowledge by submitting a pull request, opening an issue, or emailing your edits and suggestions to us directly at content@heavybit.com. Add links to great talks or blog posts, suggest different approaches and new tools, offer case studies and stories of your wins (and losses!). If it will make us better developer marketers, we want to hear about it.

##Running Locally

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Install Jekyll, clone the `gh-pages` branch and build the site using `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl` This will allow you to view your changes locally at localhost:4000 before submitting a pull-request.

##About and License

The Developer Marketing Guide is built on Jekyll and GitHub Pages, based on the [Grayscale bootstrap theme](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/)
